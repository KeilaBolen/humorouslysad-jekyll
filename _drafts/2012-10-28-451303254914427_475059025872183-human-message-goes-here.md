Borrowed from a friend:
 It really gets me when people feel the need to parrot that old idea that people who cuss do so because they are unintelligent and/or lack the vocabulary to express themselves without it. Setting aside the unimaginably sad premise that mindless adherance to arbitrary social convention is a sign of intelligence(!), somebody with a superior vocabulary please suggest to me a word that can adequately replace "fuck."
